\par Emotion forecasting is the task of predicting the future emotion of a speaker---i.e., the emotion label of the future speaking turn--based on the speaker's past and current audio-visual cues. Emotion forecasting systems require new problem formulations that differ from traditional emotion recognition systems.  
In this thesis, we first explore two types of \textit{forecasting windows} (i.e., analysis windows for which the speaker's emotion is being forecasted): utterance forecasting and time forecasting. Utterance forecasting is based on speaking turns and forecasts what the speaker's emotion will be after one, two, or three speaking turns. Time forecasting forecasts what the speaker's emotion will be after a certain range of time, such as 3--8, 8--13, and 13--18 seconds. We then investigate the benefit of using the past audio-visual cues in addition to the current utterance. We design emotion forecasting models using deep learning. We compare the performances of FC-DNN, D-LSTM, and D-BLSTM which allows us to examine the benefit of modeling dynamic patterns in emotion forecasting tasks. Our experimental results on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset demonstrate that D-BLSTM and D-LSTM outperform FC-DNN by up to 2.42\% in unweighted recall. When using both the current and past utterances,  deep dynamic models show an  improvement of up to 2.39\% compared to their performance when using only the current utterance. 
We further analyze the benefit of using current and past utterance information compared to using the current and randomly chosen utterance information, and we find the performance improvement rises to 7.53\%. 
The novelty in this study comes from its formulation of emotion forecasting problems and the understanding of how current and past audio-visual cues reveal future emotional information.

\par First and foremost, I would like to sincerely thank my advisor, Professor Gary J Saulnier, for his continuous support and guidance throughout many difficult phases of my journey for the Master's degree. This
thesis would not have been possible without his support and I can never thank
him enough for that. I would also like to express my gratitude to Dr. Yelin Kim, lead scientist in Amazon Lab126, for her continuous mentorship throughout the year 2018, while she was an assistant professor at UAlbany. She taught me the true science of research, also pushing me to keep the high standards of my work with insightful and
constructive comments. 

I would also like to express my gratitude to my thesis committee members for their valuable time and comment on my thesis: Professor Daphney-Stavroula Zois and Professor Mohammed Agamy. My special thanks to Prof. Siwei Lyu, Prof. Feng Chen (UT, Dallas), and Prof. Kevin Knuth for their enormous inspiration which motivated me for conducting my research and reshaped my thought process. 

My two years in Albany have been truly a joyful experience, and the beginning
of priceless friendships with many inspiring people. I cannot thank enough my friends at UAlbany: Priti G. Pachpande, Mohammad Khaledur Rahman, Tasmia Haque, and Shihab Ahmed. I would like to thank the faculty and stuffs of department of Electrical and Computer engineering for the constant support and guidance. I owe my deepest gratitude to my wife Jannatul Ferdoush for encouraging me in every phase of the journey while tolerating segregation from me for more than a year. Above all, this thesis is dedicated to my wonderful parents, Shafiul Islam and Sayeda Begum, for being my life-long mentors. I also thank my sister Shifat Sharmin Paula for her endless love and support. Lastly, I greatly thank University at Albany and Google for the financial support without which  my persuasion of MS degree would not be possible.
